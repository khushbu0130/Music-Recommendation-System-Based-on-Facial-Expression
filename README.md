# Music-Recommendation-System-Based-on-Facial-Expression
The project aims to develop an emotion-aware music recommendation system that uses facial expression recognition. Trained on the FER 2013 dataset, the model detects seven emotions from live webcam feed. Based on the predicted emotion, the system fetches and displays personalized song playlists from Spotify using the Spotify wrapper.
